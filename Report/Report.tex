\subsection{Context}
This project was conducted in partnernship with Our lady and st Thomas school (OLST), a  co-educational Catholic primary school consisting of around 120 students. The school has strong academic results with the percentage of students achieving expected or higher standard in reading, writing and maths is above the national and local average \cite{OLST_stats}. However it has been observed that some girl in the year six class lack confidence in maths lessons and intract less than hoped.
