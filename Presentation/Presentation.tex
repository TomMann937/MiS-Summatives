% Context of school
\begin{frame}{Context}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This projcect was conducted in partnership with Our Lady and St Thomas catholic school (OLST).
        \item OLST is a co-educational primary academy located in Willington for students aged 4 - 11. 
        \item OLST is a small school with only on class of 18-20 students per year.
    \end{itemize}

% Aims of the project, and the rational behind them
\begin{frame}{Aims}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inital consultation with teacher
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-]Increase confidence in girls ability in maths
            \item[-] This goes hand in hand with decreasing maths anxiey in girls
            \item[-] In the long term this could posisbly increase performance in girls, increasing number of girls achieving 'Greater Depth' in SATs
        \end{itemize}
        \item Focus on increasing confidence and decreasing anxiety
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-]Nationally girls peform at a very similar level to boys in SATs (Gov.uk, 2024)
            \item[-]Women are more than twice as likely to experience maths anxiety than men (National Numeracy, 2024) 
            \item[-] Boys tend to believe more than girls do that their intellectual abilities are causing their high marks in maths (Georgiou, S. N. et al, 2007)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Format of the project
\begin{frame}{Format \& Content}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lunch time sessions about 30 minutes long
        \item Only girls in the session
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] In mixed classrooms boys are more likely to speak louder and overpower the class
            \item[-] Girls are not going to worry about what boys think of them
        \end{itemize}
        \item The content of the sessions is not defined by the aims.

\begin{frame}{Session 1: Introduction}
    The aim of this project is very individual, it is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the level of maths anxiety among the girls?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-]All girls reported some level of anxiety
        \end{itemize}
        \item What are the causes  of maths anxiety?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Judgement
            \item[-] Fear of being left behind
            \item[-] Frustration
        \end{itemize}
        \item How can these causes be treated?
    \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[-] No numbers
                \item[-] Focus on the process rather than the outcome
                \item[-] Intrinsic value intervention
            \end{itemize} 
            \item This session involved the girls constructing and exploring the physical properties of a M\"{o}bius strip
            \item The aim of this session was to allow the girs to enjoy the process of exploring new ideas and not understanding something

\begin{frame}{Session 2: M\"{o}bius Strips}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The session consisted of 3 main activities
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Creating the M\"{o}bius strips
            \item Drawing on the M\"{o}bius strips
            \item Cutting the  M\"{o}bius strups
        \end{enumerate}

        \vspace{10pt}

        \item Evaluation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] The session defnitely promoted curiosity and creativity  (maybe a bit too much)
            \item[-] Some of the activites were too fiddly 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Session 3: Statistics - Data collection}
        \begin{itemize}

                \item[-] Utility value intervention
                \item[-] Getting comfortable disussing maths
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item What is statistics?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[-] How do we collect data?
                \item[-] How do we analyse data?
                \item[-] Why is statistics useful?
            \end{itemize}
            \item Students collecting their own data

        \item Physical representations of statistics
        \pause
        \item Evaluation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Students developed understanding of basic statistics
            \item[-] Didn't create as much discussion around mathematics as planned
            \item[-] Mode of delivery was very similar to a lesson 
        \end{itemize}

% TODO: Add photo of coordinate grid
\begin{frame}{Session 5: Coordinate Grid}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deisgn:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Change mode of delivery
            \item[-] Make the session activite
            \item[-] Incorperating cooeprative groups in problem solving situations 
        \end{itemize}
        \item This session involved the students solving problems which would lead them from point to point on a coordinate grid
        \item The mathematics required was taken from lessons I had seen the students complete
        \item Each student had to solve one clue to lead them to the final anwer
        \item Evalutaion:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Students were very eager to solve clues
            \item[-] Students didn't understand coordinates as much as hoped
            \item[-] The problems given were effective reivison for the children - "We had to do really difficult maths that we learnt ages ago"
            \item[-] Sacrifised quantity of learning for enjoyment
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Session 6: 1-2 Nim}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Student ownership, developing their own tool they can use in the future
            \item[-] Students work together and share their solutions
        \end{itemize}
        \item This session involved the students developing their own strategies for a simple game
        \item This task generalises allowing students to learn some basic problem solving strategies
        \item Evaluation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Students were keen to complete the task as they wanted to beat me
            \item[-] Some of the more uninterested students seemed to benefit from this type of session
        \end{itemize}
